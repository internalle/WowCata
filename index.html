                 <p  >An island off the coast of the Eastern Kingdoms, Tol Barad is a historic land now sought-after by the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance. Its strategic, isolated location makes it an ideal stronghold from which to conduct military strikes. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, a battle will be waged to seize control of this prized territory. Should you triumph, unique rewards await you.

                 <p  >During the Second War between orcs and humans, Tol Barad served as an island citadel of Stromgarde. Tol Barad was of great use to the Alliance as an isolated port for preparing military strikes... until it was invaded by the Horde and decimated. Years later the nation of Kul Tiras reclaimed Tol Barad, establishing a magical prison over the ruins of the old fortifications to contain enemy magi, demons, and a host of other deadly criminals. The existence of such a prison remains unknown to most citizens of Azeroth. In the wake of the Cataclysm and with tension building between the Horde and the Alliance, this will all change. Tol Barad will once more serve as a strategic location for amassing a deadly armada of vessels to lay siege upon enemy strongholds within the Eastern Kingdoms. Because both the Horde and the Alliance are prepared to pay in blood for control of Tol Barad, it is yet unknown which of the two factions will emerge victorious from the war-torn island. </p><BR />

                <p><img src="images/highelvesandbloodelves.jpg" alt="bloodelf" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=10 />High elves and blood elves are physiologically the same race, and they are descended from night elves. Nevertheless, the three groups do not share a close relationship due to their shared history and philosophical differences. Indeed, night elves regard high elves and blood elves with suspicion, disgust, or outright hostility.
Nevertheless, high elves and blood elves do share some characteristics with their night elf brethren. All three groups have unusually acute senses and are able to see clearly even in low-light conditions.</p>
                <p><img src="images/nightelves.jpg" alt="nelf" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=10 width=100 height=100 />In time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids were drawn by the Well's strange energies and built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the tribe, making them strong, wise, and immortal. Their skin turned various shades of violet, and they grew taller in stature. The tribe adopted the name kaldorei, which meant "children of the stars" in their native tongue.The kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped Elune, goddess of the moon, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with great curiosity, and the ongoing research of the Well became a facet of night elf society.</p>
                <p><img src="images/naga.jpg" alt="nelf" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=10 width=100 height=110 />Before the Great Sundering, the Highborne were the highest-ranking caste of night elf nobility. These privileged nobles became obsessed with the Well of Eternity and abused its magics until their activities caught the attention of Sargeras, the dark titan. He promised the Highborne that he would remake the planet Azeroth into a paradise, and that they would be rewarded with great power for serving him.For a time he held the Highborne enthralled and obedient to his wishes. At Sargeras' command, the Highborne created a portal in the Well in the hope that Sargeras would be able to enter Azeroth himself. Such was his might that Azeroth would surely have been consumed, like countless other worlds, had his plan succeeded.</p>

                Demons are evil immortals who feed upon magic and life. They delight in inflicting suffering, spreading corruption, and, of course, destroying all that is good. Most demons were once mortal. Not all demons are sentient: various animals have been transformed into demons, for instance.

In order to become a demon, a creature must be infused with fel energy. As the existence of non-sentient demons suggests, a creature's wishes are irrelevant to the process. Willing or not, a creature can be changed into a demon. Such a transformation alters the affected creature on a fundamental level and typically leaves little or nothing of that creature's original personality. Still, at least one demon has thus far maintained much of his original personality: Illidan Stormrage.</p>

               <img src="images/sentinels.jpg" alt="nelf" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=10 width=100 height=130 />
               Sentinels were established shortly after the War of the Ancients, and until recently all of its soldiers were night elf women. However, the Third War resulted in so many casualties that the traditional gender roles of night elf society have been set aside in favor of more practical concerns. As a result, although the Sentinels are still primarily women, there are now also men among their ranks.</p>
